# Introduction to Arduino


## What is Arduino?

Arduino is an open-source electronics platform based on easy-to-use hardware and software.  
It is designed for students, hobbyists, and engineers to build interactive electronic projects.

Arduino boards can read inputs (like light from a sensor, a finger on a button, or a message from a computer) and turn them into outputs (like activating a motor, turning on an LED, or displaying text on an LCD).
